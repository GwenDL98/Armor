# Armor
Armor is a quick time event game. 
On the screen you are going to see some elemtents:
- Player: a small green ball in the lower part of the scene;
- Planet: a bigger green gall in the upper part with levels in it;
- Orbit: colorful semicircles that protecta the Planet.
- Barriers: light blue lines appearing going on with levels. 

How to play:
During the initial levels, you just need to touch on the Player to hit the planet avoiding the Orbits.
Later in the levels you ca use a slingShot effect to move the player and hit the ball.
In this case it's suggested to use the barrier for a flipper effect, since he difficulty will be higher and higher.
